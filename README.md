## Testing 
The W3C Markup validator and W3C CSS validator services were used to validate the pages of the project to ensure that there were no errors in the code. 

[W3C Markup validator results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fourfalia.github.io%2Fmy-first-repository%2F)
[W3C CSS validator results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

Manual testing of all the features of the website was deploied and everything looks fuctioning such as the navigation bar, links and forms.
## Unfixed bugs 
When the website was tested on the W3C validator, it marked this error "Bad value 100% for attribute width on element iframe". I kept the 100% value for the map to cover the whole parent div and look better in contrast with the rest of the page. 

## Deployment 
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
